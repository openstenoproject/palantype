Plover does not officially support Palantype at this time, however you can download test builds of it.

To learn more about Plover, the stenography program, check out its [official website](/plover).

In the meantime, feel free to download the software below.

## Download Plover for Palantype

Download and run [plover_palantest_1.exe]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plover_palantest_1.exe)

## Setup

### If you have a Palantype machine

- you will need to have it connected to your computer and not communicating with other Palantype software
- start Plover, configure the machine to "Palantype" and wait for it to connect.
- It is recommended to remove the default dictionaries provided with Plover in the dictionary configuration dialog and replace them with RTF exports from your other software.

### If you have an NKRO keyboard

- You will need to start with a blank dictionary or [download a small dictionary]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/palantype-starter.rtf)
- Replace the default Plover dictionaries with your starter dictionary.
- Ensure to configure the keyboard mapping to understand how your QWERTY keyboard happens to the Palantype layout. You can adjust the defaults if your keyboard layout is not QWERTY.
