The Open Steno Project was founded by Mirabai Knight to bring machine stenography to everyone. She created Plover with the help of many generous people from all over the world. Plover today exists as a leader in chording software that is feature rich and more useful for some applications than proprietary software that costs thousands.

Plover has been ported to support Palantype; a system that is similar but different to stenography. This website aims to document the Palantype and how it works so that anyone who wants to learn it, can. Plover supports existing Palantype machines, but as they are rare and expensive, users can also find an [anti-ghosting/NKRO keyboard](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Supported-Hardware#keyboards) for less than Â£100 to try out the Palantype theory and see if they enjoy typing in that manner.
